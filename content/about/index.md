The department of robotics and automation(R&A) started in the year 2020 at REC, with 35
students, and now it has grown to 150+ over the years, and we strongly believe it will rise more 
in the coming years.
Our department is always open to learning and exploring new technologies even though we are 
novices.
We've already made lots of effort to give this department life. As a great stepping stone, we've 
formulated and organized AURA to outspread the knowledge of robotics and bring out more 
talents not only in R&A but in every other department. 
And as the senior most batch of R&A history, we are delighted to leave this initiative to the 
upcoming R&A buds in a way that would grow more and add value to many students. 
It is not a formal academic-centric club where we execute only a particular idea, but we're 
always open to implementing new & valuable ideas. 
As part, we welcome each one of you to feel free to contact us if you have any buzzing event 
ideas that will be useful for the students of REC. 
We are always grateful to our HOD & faculties for guiding & motivating us and allowing 
AURA to be a student-driven club
