 _Welcome to the official page of the Association for Undergraduates of Robotics and Automation_  
 {{< figure src=robogates.jpg >}}  
 

Association for Undergraduates of Robotics & Automation (AURA) is a club run entirely by 
the students of Robotics and Automation Department. It aims to be the hub for student-developed projects and strives to create a platform with the highest standards for such projects' 
exposure.

### OBJECTIVE:

AURA's vision is to bridge the gap between the students and the industry by equipping them 
with technical and non-technical attributes such as problem-solving, leadership, 
entrepreneurship, etc.

 It aims to create a group of bright young minds that supports the students' overall growth by 
carrying out activities such as
- Workshops – Hands-on Training in Robotics and related fields.
- Guest Lectures and Webinars - by industry experts and eminent professors. 
- Conferences and Symposiums – to encourage students to participate and compete. 
- Outreach programs and Awareness campaigns – to promote the importance and application 
of Robotics in the present-day world
