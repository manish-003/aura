Our department is always open to learning and exploring new technologies even though we are novices. We&amp;rsquo;ve already made lots of effort to give this department life. As a great stepping stone, we&amp;rsquo;ve formulated and organized AURA to outspread the knowledge of robotics and bring out more talents not only in R&amp;amp;A but in every other department.</description></item><item><title>Industrial Visit to KKR metal components</title><link>https://manish-003.github.io/aura/gallery/kkr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://manish-003.github.io/aura/gallery/kkr/</guid><description> Automatic Aluminium Die Cast Machine ..
